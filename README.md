# TicTacToe: Unlimited

Everyone knows tic tac toe! The game with the Xs and Os. The one where if you play it right no one wins?

Well... You know how as a kid after a while you get bored of the 3x3 tic tac toe and just start adding more rows and columns... yeah
I'm gonna try and do that! 

Will I succeed? Hopefully! 

Will this probably take a long time to run because I made it in python? Absolutely! 

Why am I doing this? I have no idea!
